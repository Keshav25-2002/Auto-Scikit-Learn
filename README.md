# Auto-Scikit-Learn

Auto-Scikit-Learn is a Python library for automating the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning using scikit-learn. The library allows users to easily and 

efficiently find the best model and hyperparameters for their data without requiring any prior knowledge or experience in machine learning.

Features:

1.Automated model selection

2.Automated hyperparameter tuning

3.Simple API for easy implementation

4.Optimized for speed and efficiency

5.Compatible with scikit-learn and pandas

How it works:

Auto-Scikit-Learn uses Bayesian optimization to search for the best model and hyperparameters for a given dataset. The library takes as input a dataset and a list of 

models and their associated hyperparameters to search over. It then iteratively trains and evaluates models using cross-validation, and selects the best performing model 

and hyperparameters.

Technologies Used:

1.Python

2.Scikit-learn

3.Pandas

4.Hyperopt

5.Joblib
